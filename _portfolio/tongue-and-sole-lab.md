Started by 3 Duke undergraduate students, we created NFTs blending different shoe silhouettes in order to bring something fresh to the sneaker community. I created our [website](https://www.tongueandsolelab.com/) and helped develop the smart contract for the generative collection.

All in all, we grew a community of 2,000 followers on Discord, partnered with 3 Instagram sneaker designers with over 50,000 followers, and sold out 1,200 NFTs in under 6 months while in school.
