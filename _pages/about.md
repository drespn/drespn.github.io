I'm Diego, I graduated from Duke where I studied Computer Science and minored in finance. At Duke, I took MBA coursework on Blockchain Consensus mechanisms taught
by [Kartik Nayak](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~kartik/) and graduate coursework surrounding Fintech and Crypto under [Craig Hurwitz](https://fintech.meng.duke.edu/faculty/craig-hurwitz). I also was a teaching assistant for 30+ graduate and undergraduate students in a graduate Fintech course led by
Craig Hurwitz. 

In college, I also founded [Tongue and Sole Lab](https://www.tongueandsolelab.com/), a sneakerhead x NFT project founded by 3 Duke undergraduates that eventually sold out. I worked as a website developer/smart contract developer alongside my co-founders.

Outside of software, I worked as a campus leader and representative growing companies like [BeReal](https://bereal.com/en/), [Fuse Technologies](https://www.fuseignited.com/), [POSH](https://posh.vip/), and more. In my role with Fuse, I worked directly with [Morvell Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morvell-johnson-8b044ab5/) and gained experience in sales through my work outside of the classroom.

At Duke, I took graduate courses and an undergraduate in Blockchain Consensus, Financial Services and Products, and Emerging Trends in FinTech Services alongside coursework
in Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science, Design/Analysis of Algorithms, and Computer Architecture.

I have also pursued online coursework in [Solana Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/solana-developer/), [iOS development](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/), and [Solidity Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/).
